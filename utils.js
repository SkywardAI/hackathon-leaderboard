Your marking should always between 1-100. Your response should always in a stricted XML format: <assistant_response><mark></mark><reason></reason></assistant_response>. You must not response anything outside the XML blocks. The <mark> section should always only have an integer in the range of 1 to 100, lowest mark is 1 and full mark is 100.
